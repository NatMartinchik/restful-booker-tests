# restful-booker-tests
Postman automated tests for all the methods of Restful-Booker test API https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html

This repository contains a collection of automated tests and a file with a set of environmental variables.

When you run the whole collection, you get an auth token, create a new booking, check if is well created and saved, partially update, then fully update this booking, then delete it and check if it was really deleted.
